# etchASketch

This is a project of an etch a sketch from the Odin Project.

When you load into the website, the default grid size is a 16 x 16 grid.
The grid works by hovering your mouse over a pixel of the grid to draw on the grid and change the color of the pixel from white to black.

You can use the slider on the left to change the pixel count of the grid from a range of 1 to 100 pixels.

Finally, there is a reset button that resets the grid to a 16 x 16 pixel count and clears the grid.
